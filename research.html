<h2>Microexperiments in global health policy</h2>
<p>We design and conduct frugal experiments targeted at identifying unique opportunities in the space of health policy
  in low and middle-income countries. Using evidence and careful reasoning, we produce analytical input intended to
  promptly inform policy-makers on issues that bear the most weight, and plausible ways to address them.</p>
